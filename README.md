Hi, I'm Helen!

I'm currently doing my masters in data science, looking to pivot careers. At the moment I'm still building my programming skills and having fun exploring the different visualation options available in different languages. There's nothing very technical here yet - I plan on adding some more statistically meaty stuff in the coming weeks.
